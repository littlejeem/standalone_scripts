# TROUBLESHOOTING
#   Always try trigger script first before hooking up to main script
#   look for ENV{DEVTYPE}=="disk" or equiv if script triggers twice
#   Doublecheck you have == (equal to) not = (assign to) in all but 'systemd wants' ENV sections, example below
#KERNEL=="sd**", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="partition", ENV{ID_VENDOR}=="SanDisk", ENV{ID_MODEL}=="Ultra", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT}=="4C530001050913121345", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="Sandisk_auto_transfer.service"
